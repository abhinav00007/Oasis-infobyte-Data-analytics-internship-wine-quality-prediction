# Prediction-of-Wine-Quality
To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine.

TO DO:
1.Classifier Models: Utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support
2.Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.
3.Chemical Qualities: Analyzing features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality.
4.Data Analysis Libraries: Employing Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array
operations.
5.Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the
dataset

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7).
